# What's this?

This is my first-ever post on this website! It took some hard work and several hours of heavy-metal
music but we did it! *Thoughts...* is a blog concept I came up with some time ago but scrapped because
of maintainability--only to revive it this past week!

The basic idea behind *Thoughts...* is I detail anything on my mind, and create posts in the
form of introspective question-answer sessions.

Now lets talk about something more interesting :).

## Why did you make this website?

This is the third rendition of my personal website, the original still hosted at [https://its.rayhanadev.repl.co](https://its.rayhanadev.repl.co)
and the second replaced by this website. Why go through the pain of created three websites? Well it
has a lot to do with **growth**. As an [IB learner](https://www.ibo.org/benefits/learner-profile/)
we are *risk-takers* and *reflective*. I was motivated to create a new site to display what I've learned
since my previous site and because I want to take a different path than what I find most
developers a doing.

## Any plans to expand?

Yes a few! I actually will use this website as a base of operations for more than developing,
instead combining my other creative projects such as photography and graphic design into
the site. Also some other interesting ideas and project integrations are soon to follow.

*Also a dark mode is coming :)*

## Conclusion

We made it here! Thank you for reading this post, I plan on making more about a variety of
topics and would love it if you hang around :D. For now, this is where I bid you adieu.
Have a great one, and till next time.
